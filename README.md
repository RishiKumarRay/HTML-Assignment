This is assignment on HTML , where i have also used CSS and made the assignment as instructed in assignment where we made a website similar to w3schools which had:
->Contains navigations links, and upon navigation should navigate to corresponding actual w3school pages .
->Contains bookmark and should navigate to that particular part of the web page.
->Table might not necessarily have the shown styling but should have collapsed the borders.
